# 🩺 AI Healthcare Diagnosis Model 🧬

This repository contains the code for a deep learning model developed for healthcare diagnosis. The model is trained to classify skin lesion images into different categories for disease diagnosis.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of skin lesion images categorized into different classes representing various skin diseases. The images are preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets.

---

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

The model architecture is built using the TensorFlow backend with the Keras library. It includes convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The final layer uses a softmax activation function for multi-class classification.


---

## 🚀 Training

The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function. Training is performed for a specified number of epochs with a defined batch size. Validation data is used to monitor the model's performance during training.

---

## 📊 Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance on unseen data. Evaluation metrics such as loss and accuracy are computed and visualized using plots.

---

## 🛠️ Usage
